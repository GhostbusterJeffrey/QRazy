## About QRazy
QRazy is a unique and innovative web-based project designed to capture and analyze data through the utilization of QR codes. Functioning as a captivating social experiment, QRazy serves as an interactive platform that seeks to shed light on the patterns and behaviors associated with QR code scanning.

At its core, QRazy allows users to generate QR codes that can be strategically placed in various locations. These QR codes are armed with specific URL parameters that convey essential information, including the precise location of each code and a designated redirect URL. When individuals interact with these QR codes by scanning them with their smartphones or devices, QRazy springs into action.

Upon scanning a QR code, QRazy's intricate mechanism is set in motion. The platform meticulously logs the timestamp of the scan along with the location parameter embedded within the URL. This data is then seamlessly dispatched to a designated Discord Webhook – a virtual communication channel – ensuring that every QR code scan triggers an instant notification in a specified Discord server or channel.

The Discord notification serves as a fascinating real-time snapshot, encapsulating not only the precise time when the QR code was scanned but also revealing the unique location associated with each code. This enables users to gain valuable insights into the geographic distribution of QR code interactions. Furthermore, this unique fusion of technology and data collection provides an opportunity to delve into the demographics of the individuals who are drawn to the QR codes, thus potentially uncovering trends and preferences among different user groups.

In summary, QRazy revolutionizes the conventional concept of QR code utilization by transforming it into a dynamic and interactive experiment. Through its seamless integration of QR codes, data logging, and Discord notifications, QRazy offers an engaging platform for exploring the patterns, behaviors, and preferences of individuals interacting with these enigmatic symbols. Whether it's in educational institutions, public spaces, or events, QRazy presents a novel approach to data collection and analysis that is both captivating and insightful.
